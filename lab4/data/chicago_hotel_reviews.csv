My room was amazing, I loved the kitchen area complete with a fridge, microwave, stove, and dishwasher. Everything was spotless clean and I loved the huge bathroom. The location was quite nice (only a ten minute walk from the heart of downtown) and Harry Carey's and House of Blues was across the street. Staff was kind and helpful. Free breakfast, evening appetizers, and evening drinks were excellent bonuses. I WILL be staying here again!

We were warmly greeted by Frances who checked us in without any problems. Our room was excellent, and YES, the window-seats are so cool! So nice to cuddle up in a blanket with a cup of coffee and watch all the shoppers scurrying around the streets.We had traditional Thanksgiving dinner at McCormick &amp; Schmick's, less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Starbucks coffee in the lobby each morning was wonderful, and the wine reception in the evening was very nice. The hotel sets up the Wii for the kids to enjoy while their parents sip their wine and relax.The hotel is amazingly friendly and comfortable. Everyone on the staff had a smile on their face, even on Thanksgiving day. That means so much. Finally, the location. What else can be said? Perfection.

6,usa_illinois_chicago_park_hyatt_chicago,"Nov 19 2009 	GREAT FIVE STAR	I have become a huge fan of Park Hyatt Hotels since my last few great stays with them. Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental don't have loyalty programs, so when I go on business trips I'm motivated by getting the points. Something about getting a free night stay with two or something got me to check out the Park Hyatts. And I'm glad I did.This hotel has a spectacular, modern lobby. Fantastic spa. We had a great view from our room (see picture). The tub was super deep and they gave really great eucalyptus salts that were awesome after a long day of meetings. The room service menu had a great selection of sushi. Breakfast on the 7th floor was really nice with a great view.Criticism: the wifi at our room (1605) was non-existent. I don't know why. And also - be VERY specific on getting directions to the entrance the building is the huge water tower place and if you go to the GPS marked location you'll for sure be lost. Ask concierge on your way in specifically how to find the entrance, we circled around for about half an hour. Other than that, it's great. You have a semi-great room experience with the master bath opening into the living room. We loved it. Oh - sheets could've been softer.

7,usa_illinois_chicago_springhill_suites_chicago_downtown_river_north,"	Definite Return Trip to this One!	This was a really terrific hotel that I will definitely frequent again. My husband &amp; I come to Chicago every year at Thanksgiving for my birthday so we have stayed in many places over the years - Hampton, Monaco, Hotel 71, Hilton Garden Inn, Wyndham, Four Points Sheraton, etc. Knowing my way around Chicago, I chose to try the Springhill Suites on Dearborn and am I glad I did! Although the location is great, just a couple of blocks off Michigan &amp; State, it's actually easy to miss the hotel - the signage outside is quite plain and it shares an entrance w/ Residence Inn. The actual lobby for both chains is on the 2nd floor. Check-in was great, staff very accommodating -- I even got a bottle of wine for my birthday. The elevators are the fastest and smoothest of any hotel I've ever stayed in. The hotel offers a nice hot/cold complimentary breakfast as well - a bit early for a &quot;leisure&quot; trip (6:30-9:00 a.m.). We had a &quot;studio&quot; double room. It was perfect, very chic and modern. Sitting area had a desk, chaise, and sleeper couch and was separated from bedroom area by frosted glass. Plenty of lighting (which is a big complaint w/ me because most rooms are just too dark). We had a microwave, frig, and coffee maker. Bath area was good size and vanity area was separate w/ plenty of top space to put items. The only issue I had was the lack of good sized drawers for clothes that you didn't want to hang .. there were only (2) very shallow drawers. I would rate this hotel as EXCELLENT.

The Concierge were amazing. Christopher was the most helpful, enthusiastic and professional concierge we have ever met. All the concierge knew our names by the end of the first day (2 adults, 4 children aged 4,5,6,9) and greeted us with genuine enthusiasm. For Australians travelling to Chicago, this hotel reminded us of home, no 'fake' American service, genuine care! Rooms were big and extremely clean. Just wish there was a coin laundry nearby! Great pizza restaurants next door and within 1 block from the hotel. For Australians wanting a proper cup of coffee...there is a french bakery nearby that has great morning meals! Well Done Christopher and the boys at Concierge....thank you for making a long trip so pleasant!

We were able to get a Corner King on the 21st floor. It was a great view. The pluses-Amazing bed-The shower was very lavish-Hotel staff were very helpful-Breakfast (free if you make your reservations online) was delicious and very filling-Location (near Mag Mile with a Whole Foods around the corner for easy snacks)-MP3 docking station was a nice add on-The gym was sufficient for a quick workout-The Spa was helpful and my massage felt wonderful after alot of walking around Chicago and my wife enjoyed her manicure and facial. Minuses -The second floor entrance was a slight problem but nothing that you can't handle-The ceilings were much to look at-The Spa prices were higher than we were used to but seemed to be inline with downtown Chicago. So as you can see I don't have alot of negative things to say about Dana. The service was great, the view was wonderful and the amenities were lavish. I would recommend this hotel to young couples or hip familes visiting Chicago for leisure

12,usa_illinois_chicago_the_blackstone_a_renaissance_hotel,"	Room and service was horrible	When we arrived at the hotel we were properly greeted and taken up to our rooms. When we got into our room the furniture inside was stained and really beat up. The worst part of the room was the bathroom door. The bathroom was fitted with a sliding door that did not go into the wall but alongside it. The door had no lock and left about a 2-3 inch gap where if you walked by it you could see someone on the toilet. The concierge was not helpful on suggestions of restraunts or nightlife. The concierge told us that we were better off staying in our rooms since there was &quot;nothing to do in chicago after 10 pm&quot;. Our last night we ordered a movie and the quality of the movie was horrid (movie was pixelating and blurry) so we called down and I had to argue with the person at the front desk to have them credit us the money back for the movie after we had stopped it less than 5 minutes in. This is not a full service hotel we had to pay about 10 bucks for anything and everything. We had to pay about 12 dollars to have them bring us up extra glasses since the old ones were dirty and the maid did not switch them out. The only redeeming thing about my trip was the fun I had with my friends not the hotel.

14,usa_illinois_chicago_amalfi_hotel_chicago,"	Very disappointed after having read the reviews	I like boutique hotels. But, this one feels cheap and it's not clean. First of all I asked if I could have a quiet room - yes, they respond. Only to get a corner room full of windows facing the main street. It's impossible to block out the lights (and noise) with many pairs of curtains that you could not get to stay closed. In the bathroom, there was a used towel hanging over the shower curtain. After letting the front desk know, it was actually there the next day as well. The phone had long black hairs on the panel of the phone. The rugs were dingy - just did not feel clean in anyway. There's no real room service and the &quot;free&quot; continental breakfast is not even as good as like a Hampton Inn. When i checked out and checked the bill the rate was 50% more than my colleagues - and when I asked why they said it was my travel agents fault as they did not book a corporate rate. They were so unhelpful and actually quite rude. For $365, you have to be kidding . . . .

We splurged and booked a Deluxe Suite on the 38th floor. The highlight of the rooms was the window seat nook that ran along the length of the lakeside view of the room. Nice cushiions and pillows made this a great place to curl up with the paper/book &amp; coffee/wine. Although my kids enjoyed lining up their Star Wars figures for the ultimate galactic showdown. Spacious two room suite with a comfortable FEATHER BED on the pull-out sofa (loved by the kids), plenty of floor space, chair, table, desk and HD tv entertainment center.Loved the bed in our bedroom--nice bathroom &amp; shower with a deep tub perfect for a bubble bath soak.I do miss having the convenience of a coffee maker in the room, but the complementary spa/pool area serves bottled water &amp; orange juice throughout the day and coffee in the morning hours.The pool is beautiful, large and welcoming with a great hot tub as well. Pool toys are kept in a large storage bin to be shared. We love the Four Seasons because of the special treatment our kids receive when we are there. Upon check-in, we found a tray of iced cow shaped cookies, milk in an ice bucket, a pitcher of chocolate syrup and a battery powered &quot;moo moo mixer&quot; the kids could use to mix up their chocolate milk. That was in addition to the crayons, coloring book &amp; Sorry board game placed on the desk.The next afternoon we found individually boxed cupcakes for each of them, and the following day glasses filled with gummi bears and a paper drink umbrella. They also love the child size fluffy white robes that are included for their use as well as the kid pack of bath amenities.Bob--part of the bell staff provided excellent service and greeted our children by name each time we saw him over our stay.These things matter and are part of the reason we love the Four Seasons.

18,usa_illinois_chicago_thewit_hotel,"	Trying too hard and forgets the basics	TheWit is trying to be a trendy, hip hotel, but has forgotten the basics that guests are looking for--comfort &amp; service. The rooms are uncomfortable--small, odd furniture, the bathroom sink is strangely shaped and so tiny that it fails to drain water. The bathroom door slides open, which was annoying and leaves for very little privacy. The service is spotty. We had requested items from housekeeping and had to call multiple times. In the interim, we received a rubix cube and jelly apple--fun touches, but would much rather have received the towels that were needed. I can't imagine staying at this hotel on a business trip. The internet is not free and overall the hotel room is hard to function in, given the size and odd design of the bathroom. The hotel gym and rooftop bar were top notch, but not a reason to stay at the hotel or recommend it. Go elsewhere for a more polished and relaxing stay.

The room was very clean, but the hotel is a bit cheap when it comes to bathroom amenities. There were two of us booked in the room--why only one bath robe? Turn down service was spotty. One night we had a drink in the room; our wine glasses were taken but never returned until we called. There is a service called &quot;Delighted to Service&quot;----the person who answered when I called apparently wasn't told you were supposed to be friendly when a hotel guest calls!The bar in the hotel, Novo is a complete rip-off. One night 4 of us met for drinks. 2 of my friends ordered the special martinis at $11 each. When the first one arrived, we laughed and joked that the waitress must have been thristy since it wasn't even 3/4 full; the second maritini was also less then 3/4 full so we joked that the waitress must have tripped and spilled some. The friend who ordered an expensive wine got about 2 inches of wine, if that.The hotel does have great facilities for conferences which is why we were there. It is not cheap. I might stay there again, but if they want to rate the hotel as a 4 star, the overall experience needs to be upgraded.

20,usa_illinois_chicago_the_sutton_place_hotel,"	""The Finest Chicago Hotel I have stayed at to date""	This past week I stayed at the Sutton Place Hotel in downtown Chicago. I was attending a medical conference and the location of the hotel, within walking distance of the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;, downtown and the Lakeshore made it a perfect location.&quot; I have stayed in many of Chicago's finest hotels, many of which are typically priced well above the level of the Sutton Place Hotel. I have never stayed in a finer hotel in Chicago. As a comparison, my medical conference was held in a &quot;Five Star&quot; hotel, five minutes walking distance from the Sutton Place. I was in several of the rooms at this &quot;Five Star&quot; hotel as a guest of fellow physicians. I in fact have stayed in this &quot;Five Star&quot; hotel several times in the past, yet without question the Sutton Place Hotel was finer, in my opinion, in all respects. The Sutton Place Hotel's price was one quarter of this &quot;Five Star&quot; hotel. I was placed on the Penthouse Suite of the Sutton Place, I had a perfect view, my room was spotless. Both room service and the attached restaurant / bar were excellent. The hotel offers a business center in which guests are able to use the internet for free, which allows me to leave my laptop at home. The valet parking rates, with hotel validation, are a very good deal. I would HIGHLY recommend any Chicago traveler, for business or pleasure to stay at the Sutton Place Hotel.

Our room, with a view of the Chicago River, was by no means over-the-top luxurious, but it was well-designed and spacious, with good lighting and comfortable seating. A quiet room and the Westin &quot;Heavenly Bed&quot; made for excellent sleeping conditions for someone who often does not sleep well even in better hotels. Service in the hotel was polite and efficient.What keeps this hotel from receiving a top rating: (1) lack of any &quot;wow&quot; factor: the room, while comfortable, was also generic; (2) no free wi-fi; (3) the food we were served in the banquet rooms (for a wedding) was fairly indifferent in quality, even for banquet food. Still, if the price is right, this hotel can offer a very good deal.

I think I had accidently read the reviews for the Express prior to coming, so I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the right hotel. It is new hotel, with nice facilities, nice large flat screen, and comfortable beds.Side note to this story, I booked the hotel through bidding on priceline. The receptionist was very nice while checking us in. I inquired about the cost of leaving our car in the hotel lot during our weekend trip. She told me that it would be $10/day. I decided to talk to over with my husband, only because there our a few slightly less expensive parking options. The next morning, I went to the receptionist to say we were interested in leaving our car. She said there was a promotion going on for anyone who stayed at the hotel and that it would be free. Not sure if the promotion wasnt supposed to also be with priceline purchases, but it worked for us and we happily saved $50 on parking. Food wise, there are tons of nearby restaurants. TGIF was next to the hotel. When checking in, the receptionist gave us a menu for Giordanos Pizza which was nearby. They delivered to our room about an hour after ordering. The pizza is great; I just wish that we had eaten at the actual restaurant, as the pizza was really messy to eat in the room. The shuttle came every 20 minutes, was prompt, clean, and the drivers were friendly. The hotel is right next to the airport (no noise problems) so the shuttle takes less than 10 minutes to get to the airport, even with the other stops.Overall, the experience was excellent; this hotel will be our future choice when we are staying at Midway.

We did just that and had dinner at a restaurant that was personally recommended by the manager. The next morning at 5 a.m., we came down the stairs and the driver was waiting next to the van with the doors open to take us to Midway.

The Omni is a really nice suite-style hotel. The suite was very clean and simply decorated. Having the two rooms with actual doors that closed between the rooms was very handy. We never felt on top of one another. We went to the hotel restaurant, 676, which was great. All of the staff---front desk, bell staff, concierge, housekeeping just couldn't have been friendlier. Honestly, that was probably the nicest part of the hotel. I voted the value down a little bit, because the cost of valet parking was so high at $49/night. It's been a couple of years since we were in Chicago...but $49 seems pretty high. One thing that I would vote to change if anyone asked...add another kid-friendly channel (Disney Channel or Cartoon Disney) to the cable TV line-up. Sometimes Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon aren't very appealing to the younger kids. We love Chicago and the kids are already asking when we can go back. So much to do...so little time!

Normally I would like to avoid using names but I feel that Rachel should be mentioned. She should NOT be in the service industry! When a couple in front of us asked for a statement folio she slammed down the phone in anger and was huffing and puffing, me and my friend were actually too scared to approach her at any point to ask any questions incase she exploded in the same way. She was always in the back office and never manning the front desk and i dont believe i seen her smile once her attitude was appalling. There was also another lady whos name I didnt get, she was also quite ignorant and abrupt. On the bright side the valet staff and another 2 front desk staff a young girl and boy were both very friendly so we were actually able to get in a few questions here and there.

I am a traveler and I enjoy staying with good hotels , but first I always check the reviews and what people have to say about the location I am willing to check in with. In Chicago (our favorite city) we usually stay at the Palmer house ( Hilton ) , Hilton Garden inn, Conrad, Chicago Hilton or Marriott on Michigan Ave. Our destination is always the Magnificent mile especially the closest to Michigan Ave. So far, we found out that the best hotel in Chicago is and still the Conrad on Rush street ( off Grand and Michigan ). But, this time of the year and during the thxgiving break we all spend it in Chigo every year, we couldn't get the rate we wanted, except when we went on BOOKING.COM and we found a good deal to stay with Comfort suites on 320 N. Michigan Ave. WOW, and WOW, we were really surprised. Small lobby, yes , but the room is spacious, it is long more than it is wide, unbelievably clean, ( that's what I also saw in the reviews before our stay), very good help there, they are trying hard to accomodate all their customers, not bad as customer service at all, what we are surprised about is the room. Big room and actually I must say they are all suites, with even washers and dryers inside the suite. Great value, good hotel, clean, mostly all suites with view of the river and Michigan Avenue. My wife agreed with me to stay with them always from now on. We are going back there after Christmas. We loved it, and I advice you to go ahead and make your plan to Chicago and give them your business.

Once on Michigan there are a plethora of restaurants and bars to choose from.I'll break my review down to a few aspects of the hotelCheck In: Not a pleasant experience. There were 3 big groups checking in the same time as us and 1 person manning the check in counter. After 15 minutes they eventually pulled someone else over. Finally after nearly 30 minutes they gave us our key. They conveniently forgot about the $25 gift card we selected on their website. Forget about that. Its not a gift card. Its a promise to pay reabate that you must mail in when you return home. Thanks!Room: We were put on the top floor orignally in a terrible room with no view. We called down to the front desk to see if we could be switched. After 20 rings, and no answer, I headed downstairs. I asked for a corner room, as I requested on the internet. They finally gave use one, saying it only had a queen beed. I didnt care about that. This room was awesome with an extra long window facing the lake (partially obstructed by taller buildings). New LG LCD tv and another window facing North (John Hancock partially visable).Pool: Forget about it. Its a glorified hot tub, except the water is freezing. If your looking for a nice relaxing swim - dont stay here.Staff: Most of the staff were helpful, nothing execptional though. I had a run in with the restaurant bartender the Saturday night they were there. He was running his mouth and shooting down all of his customers opinions on the upcoming NFL season. I blurted out &quot;your an idiot&quot; and he totally freaked out. Took my drink from me, told me I'm cutoff , and asked me to leave the bar. Needless to say this really irritated my wife and I and we complained the next day to the barley 30 year old manager. He was useless and didnt offer us anything in compensation.Restaurant - Good for drinks, didnt try the food, avoid sitting at the bar when there is a tall skinny black haired kid with long sideburns.Overall - I would definetly check out the proper Marriott , Hilton, or Renaissance next time I stay downtown Chicago.

If you are flying in, then they have a very frequent shuttle to pick you up from ORD. And if you are driving-in just for the weekend, the hotel is adjacent to the Blue Line Station to get into the city. Traffic can be maddening.They have an good fitness room in the basement and the pool area is adjacent with families. The only caution is that I would recommend any room ending in ##14, you will be away from the freeway and the room is set up as a 1 bedroom. Many room have the TV on a lazy Susan/dresser separating the sleeping area from the living area. Other thing, all bathrooms are modern walk-in showers--no tubs...

For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. I said no, and she called down to check. Apparently, no one had even called Security to get me back into my room! She had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. Then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. It was a little after 10:30pm. We were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about &quot;24 hour dining.&quot; That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in.I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service. I don't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again. BTW, the spa is great to hang out in, even if you're not doing a massage.

I am unfamiliar with Chicago, but knew I wanted to stay near the museum and Millenium Park. On a value travel website, I found a rate for Hotel Blake less than half their advertised rate and I was sold. Reviews said it was 3-4 stars, but I really wasn't sure what to expect.When we showed up, I was pleasantly surprised. It's in a good neighborhood, and only a few minutes walk from Michigan avenue. We checked in very late, but the desk staff was courteous and helpful, though we did have to unpack and carry our bags ourselves. Valet-parking was available from the hotel, but half price parking is available literally just down the street from the hotel. When we made it to our room on the 9th floor, I was amazed at the room. Large room, magnificent bed, good decorations, huge bathroom. There was no train or traffic noise on the 9th story, and we both got excellent sleep on the comfortable mattress. Free wifi, excellent soap, shampoo, body wash, etc... even a sewing kit. The room definitely deserved four stars, my only minor quibble was a little mold in the shower stall of an otherwise impeccable bathroom. We never really tried the TV, but the room clock connected to my ipod, which I thought was neat.The free breakfast was great and unexpected, but I recommend getting there early as they ran out of donuts and danishes well before the posted closing time. Service was uniformly cordial and helpful, recommending good restaurants and nearby attractions. (awesome, but get there early). The pictures of Chicago posted on the Hotel Blake website were not representative of the actual view from the hotel, but google maps let me know what to expect in the vicinity. Overall, I heartily recommend the Hotel Blake and will probably stay there again if I can get the same rate.

Location right accross from the Zoo, Observatory and Park. Wonderful quiet location and a nice neighborhood. We stayed in Chicago for 4 nights and had booked our outher 3 nights at the Doubletree near Michigan Ave though Doubletreee was nice, no way as large or comfortable as our rooms at the Belden-Stratford. We had 2 bathrooms, living room, dinning room, fully equiped kitchen and another small room with a bed. Place was very charming and we all agree loved having all the extra space, would not stay any place else. The only problem you will need to take a cab to the center of Chicago which can run about $20, cab fair from the airport ran $30, but you can also catch a bus on the corner for a lot cheeper traveling into town. The hotel also offers free breakfast and has a lovely restaurant/sidewalk cafe. You must take a boat tour of the city, we picked up our tour at the New Trump tour. We went to the Chicago Art Institute which was wonderful, only thing would skip the 3rd floor, art on that floor was not our taste. Navy Pier is very nice, we went on a tall ship with a Pirate who told you wonderful true stories of the Pirates in Chicago. One of my favorite things was we went to a Chicago Cubs game and got to se the old stadium. Would love to go back to Chicago, just love the city.

Got into town early on a Friday, staff was extremely nice and helpful even though they didn't have our room ready because it was so early. Stored our luggage for us and even let us get some items back out after they had already stored them. Went out and did some sightseeing and came back to check-in which was a breeze and found out that they had given us a free upgrade to a suite because it was our anniversary. Room was very nice and clean with lots of room to spread out and relax. Later on in our stay, I realized I had forgot my shaving gel and call the front desk to see if they help me out since we were running late for our dinner reservations and someone was up to our room in no time flat with some shaving cream.One of the greatest things about this hotel is its location. You are right in the middle of EVERYTHING on Michigan Ave!! You have all the shopping you could want and more with the ability to run your bags up to your room and not drag them all over town. You have quick access to numerous restaurants that are just short walks from the lobby, as well as bus stops across the street that will take you to various museums and other points of interest in the city. The only thing I could see someone faulting this place with is the noise from Northwestern Hospital right next door. We were on the 27th floor and the noise did not bother us at all and my wife is a very light sleeper. Other then that, Avenue Hotel is a great place to stay and enjoy Chicago and we look forward to returning soon.

There is a TGI Fridays within walking distance and Giordano's (famous for their Chicago deep dish pizza) within driving distance - that's pretty much it. The pool is very nice and the rooms are typical residence inn. If you have never stayed here, the one bedroom is the same size as a studio with a wall.

Had flat screen tvs, analog, which was kind of wierd but then we barely were in the rooms so it was no big deal. The rooms, halls and breakfast area was immaculate. I didn't use the exercise room but 5 others did and had no complaints. The breakfast was free - eggs, sausages, hash browns, muffins, breads, pastry, cereal, fruit, coffee and juice. Not like an upscale hotel but certainly good value. Also free wi-fi which most Hiltons don't give you so it is a nice plus. There is also a business center if you didn't bring your laptop. The front desk, particularly, the concierge-type person was very helpful. Parking is outrageous like all of Chicago. This was $42/day but you did get in and out service if you wanted it. Yes, some of the wood furniture is slightly worn but it is really no big deal. We paid $169 plus tax so not bad. The double suite was huge. It had a full kitchen - full size refrigerator, 2 burner stove top, sink, microwave, dishes, silverware,glasses and pots and pans. Had pull out sofa, desk with chair, 2 oversize stuffed chairs and 2 regular dining chairs so there was plenty of room for the 10 of us. It was our party room.The location is very good, especially if you are young. We are not but still there was plenty of places to eat and clubs all over. Taxi's were easy to catch or you can walk. It is on the corner of Dearborn and Illinois so you are only a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave.Also, yes you are close to the fire station but it is no big deal. The place also has room service and the Rosebud Trattoria is attached.

I'd forgotten my glasses on the bedside table, and called the desk several times to ask if they found them. No response. I ended up stopping by the hotel on the next trip to Chicago a week later, and spent an excruciating half-hour with an arrogant concierge who could not care less about anything. Only after the next shift arrived did the new concierge pop into the next room, which was lost-and-found, and sure enough, there they were, with the room number and date of my stay.

It's a block from the Cultural Center and the train station, a couple of blocks from the theater district, the Art Institute, Macy's, etc, etc....It's right by the river walk, plenty of breakfast/lunch spots scattered about. The Hard Rock is into music, giving you the option of renting a Gibson (?) guitar to use if you'd like. Unfortunately, music is one of 2 areas they fell short of perfection for us.

70,usa_illinois_chicago_hotel_felix,"	Would not recommend this hotel. We were very dissatisfied.	Stayed this past weekend 11/26 - 11/28 to celebrate one year anniversary. When I booked our stay directly with the hotel, I booked a large King room. $215.00 was the quoted rate. I requested a higher floor room with an east view since the main picture on Hotel Felix Chicago website is a lovely picture of the Chicago skyline including a beautiful view of the John Hancock tower. I was told that everything would be taken care of and we were going to receive a larger King room with a lovely view. We arrived early Friday and we were told that housekeeping was just finishing getting our room ready for us. We were each given a free drink coupon to have a drink in the front lobby small bar/lounge and were told that our bags would be brought up to the room while we waited in the lounge. About 1/2 hour later, we went to our room on the 9th floor (the hotel consists of 12 floors). It was a King room, but when I looked out our window at our view - we were facing South, not East and our view was a paid parking lot and Copperfield's (a liquor store).The next morning, I spoke with guest services and questioned the room. I was told that we received the same room that a &quot;celebrity&quot; receives when staying. The gentleman, who will remain nameless as I don't want to give names, said that we had been upgraded from room 906 to room 904, which is a larger King room. I still questioned why we didn't receive the East view as promised, and was told that we could have an East view room, but we would be downgrading to a Queen size much smaller room. So, we chose to stay in our room. Following is my complete laundry list review of the hotel:Here are the problems we found with the hotel:1.) Given multiple excuses for their lack of service/continuity. The information I received when asking about why we didn't receive the room we were promised, I feel was inadequate and unprofessional. We had breakfast the next morning in their restaurant, &quot;Elate&quot; and I asked for a spoon for my coffee. Our server stated that they were getting ready for lunch set-up and that's why I wasn't given a spoon. We were also told by our server that the restaurant and hotel were in no way connected to each other when we asked about trading up our breakfast vouchers that we paid for to get a better breakfast and pay the difference in cost. He told us that we had to take it up with the hotel because the restaurant and hotel were not connected in any way. The same female that checked us in at the hotel on Friday afternoon was now hostessing in the restaurant on Saturday morning. To me, that seems connected. In addition, the restaurant provides room service for the hotel and gives you the option to bill the room when you dine in the restaurant. To me, that seems connected.2.) It states that they provide &quot;whisper quiet rooms&quot;. That is an inaccurate description. You can hear the t.v., conversations, etc... in the adjacent rooms and in the hallway. I would honestly compare the sound level to staying at a cheap hotel. That's not what you want in a top-star hotel and certainly not what I would classify good when wanting to have a romantic weekend. I would certainly never bring my three-year old son for fear of what he may hear coming from another guest's room.3.) Storage for your clothing and suitcase is insufficient. There is no suitcase fold-out provided and the tiny closet is poorly designed. There is a tiny built in closet space with a hanging bar that also acts as a curtain rod to close and hide your belongings , but they chose to put a shelf in the middle with a safe on it. There is also a face-out bar below the shelf, but any item you put on it drags on the floor and if you use the top curtain rod to hang on, your items are jammed up against the safe and the shelf and you can't close the curtain. When we walked in our room there was the ironing board just leaned against the wall because there is no where even it can be stored.4.) The bathroom itself was a decent size, but a very small sink and lack of mirror for two people, and the adjustable shower head is set at a very low height. If you raise the shower head for normal height, the 1/2 length shower curtain causes a tiny flood in the bathroom because it doesn't extend the full length of the bathtub/shower.5.) When stating luxury comfort bathrobes provided for a room that is booked for 2 adults, we only had one bathrobe in our room. I asked for another and never received it during our 2 day stay. Perhaps there was a shortage of robes.6.) Pillows - they only offer one size of pillows on the bed and they are quite full and uncomfortable to sleep on. I like a fuller pillow, but could not use their pillows. My fiancee slept pillow-less and I had to try my best to just stay on the edge of the pillow. The next day we spoke to housekeeping directly (to avoid guest services) and she provided us with what seemed to be (2) throw pillows and put them in pillowcases for us so we could sleep. We did appreciate her effort to make us comfortable.7.) I do not feel that the food in the restaurant &quot;Elate&quot; is consistent. I would recommend their coffee and the Felix burger. (Side note: they don't put cheddar or any other cheese on it if you request it. We did request them to replace the &quot;creamed leeks&quot; with cheddar cheese if possible and it came with nothing). The seasoned fries that come with the burger are good. Their french style omelet with house potatoes is good as well, but the granola, the quiche, the 2 eggs how you want them and the french toast was not enjoyable. I am a trained chef and I was dissatisfied with the quality of the food overall.When we checked out , our receipt that was given at checkout did not match what Hotel Felix charged our Mastercard. We were charged the upgraded room rate that we didn't request. The hotel also charged us for bottled water that we did not drink in the room. After calling guest services once I returned home and discovered this on my online checking, I have been told that the credit will be made and I should expect it within 2 - 3 business days. I would be sure to obtain a receipt at checkout and make sure you are charged correctly as we were not. They overcharged us $645.00 that we are waiting to be credited to our Mastercard.Good things about I found about the hotel:1.) great location - but promise of being &quot;whisper quiet&quot; not fulfilled. Also disregard the photo of the view on the website of this hotel. West side has construction of a large building approximately 20 feet from your window and is completely obstructed.2.) nice H20 spa products for bathroom (soap, shampoo, conditioner)3.) Free wi-fiI would not stay in the hotel again and I would not recommend it. I feel as though they tried to put too many rooms into this hotel when they revamped the building, which doesn't allow for soundproofing. I also feel like we were given far too many excuses for their lack of service.

Closest Walgreen's is a mile and a half of semi-dangerous walking away. The hotel is literally surrounded by housing projects and there are almost no taxis to be found. To be fair, if you have a bus pass, the beginning of civilization is only a 20 minute bus ride away, but for ME, that is 20 minutes too far. I think my company paid almost $200 per night and I know there are hotels in the middle of the action for that price. If you have a car and don't mind that you are on the SOUTH SIDE of Chicago, by all means, stay there. If I have my choice, I won't.

The location was great (right next to Nordstrom's on Michigan Ave) for the meeting and for after hours events. The room was relatively clean and well maintained, and staff was responsive to special requests. Why would I probably not stay here again? There are so many options within the area of Michigan Ave, and most are probably more up to date. While the hotel has been cosmetically upgraded with great sheets/flat screen tv/etc, it simply isn't up to current hotel standards when you're talking about a room over $200 per night. An older hotel, our room was small, the doors were very narrow, the bathroom was extremely small (5x6) with hardly enough room to close the 24&quot; door (and we're just average size folks), the light switch upon entering the room was located inside the closet, the beds are extremely soft (although staff quickly added a bedboard upon request). Because our room and bathroom were so small, we would probably opt for a different hotel in the area with more up to date comforts next time we visit. Not a problem if you're traveling alone or at a pure business meeting, but most families or couples out for a romantic setting would want just a little more room.

77,usa_illinois_chicago_holiday_inn_chicago_o_hare,"	This is a remarkable place.	We drove to chicago, but we wanted to park and use the metro. I chose this hotel because it has free parking and claimed to be close to public transportation. Well, let me tell you the claim is true!!. It is an easy walk to a blue line train stop with a direct line to the loop and downtown. The walk is probably less than 1500 feet to get to the trains, and you can clearly see the hotel while standing on the platform waiting for the train. However, the secret to this place is the view. If you can request a room on an upper floor facing to the east you will be surprised to have a gorgeous view of the downtown Chicago skyline. I was able to sit up in bed and have my coffee looking at the sun bouncing off the Sears tower every morning. Amazing. I was surprised that they dont adverise the view from these rooms, but then again, only the upper level rooms on the east side would have the view. Even without the view, however, this place was great and we will return again. Photos of the view to be posted soon.

We looked forward to coming back to our room every evening, our &quot;island of tranquility&quot;, which overlooked the river and was very quiet. The front desk and housekeeping staff made us feel like special guests every day. We really liked the free internet access in the link caf; the complimentary Starbuck's coffee and Tazo Teas are a generous and welcome amenity. Every hotel employee we met was helpful and pleasant. We loved the central location for our stay during Thanksgiving Week and will not hesitate to return to this hotel when the next opportunity presents itself.

I didn't book this hotel, a family member did as a bunch of us flew in for a wedding. If I had to spend more than 36 hours there I would have left for somewhere else. This hotel, which I actually saw on some websites had 5 stars, was a dump. It was more like staying in a college dorm than a hotel. The room smelled. The carpet was gross and old. There was no real closet. The worst part was they didn't have a fitted bedsheet for the mattress- they put a top sheet on for the bottom sheet, which of course slid off anytime you moved. The room was just disgusting.When we checked in Friday night, about 830, we were hungry, but the resaurant was closed (except for the bar). We did eat at the restaurant for breakfast, and it was actually good (great pancakes)- the only good part of the whole hotel.The hotel is only close to the convention center. EVERYTHING else is a cab ride. They have a one-way shuttle downtown, but only leaves every hour. When I inquired about it, the concierge didn't know the times it left and didn't tell me that I could make a reservation for it (fortunately my family member found out and reserved us seats or that would have been another cab fare).Overall, for this same money I've stayed in Marriott Courtyards and Hampton Inns 10x as nice. This place was just horrible.

We did not spend much time in it as we caught the shuttle to Midway and from there got on the mass transit train to go downtown. This is not hard to do, although one has to walk through the airport to the opposite side (East?) to get on the trains. We did this trip to Chicago without a vehicle, purchasing our passes from a kiosk at the airport. They are then good to ride any bus or train. My favorite part of the hotel was the bed! It was THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept on - anywhere! The linens are all completely washable, and you get the impression that they have just been laundered before you use them. We had a microwave and a refrigerator and that met our needs quite well. For our family of four the suite was a little small when we had the rollaway out and the sofa bed opened, but again, this was only when it was time to sleep. We found the staff to be quite helpful and enthusiastic, and the cookies in the evenings were wonderful; just get there early!

Its location is superb, situated two minutes from the start of the Magnificent Mile and all the shopping you can endure. However, that's pretty much where it ends for me. Rooms were average, poorly decorated, and not 4-star quality. The iPod functionality on my clock was broken, no pens were provided in-room, and colleagues who stayed on other floors constantly complained about noise and distractions that prevented them from getting a good night's rest. Sources of noise include:- Elevator doors opening/closing- Elevator gears- Street noise- Water running through the pipesUnfortunately, all the noises above were not momentary but persisted through the entire night due to the placement of their rooms and throughout the week we stayed at the Hyatt. It's almost like the building was designed with no consideration for sound-proofing! To also not have internet included at the price we paid was almost highway robbery... isn't it archaic to still charge for in-room internet nowadays?With that said, the hotel is still a decent stay. The service was acceptable and friendly. The location was convenient, and the view was amazing. I would still recommend this to a friend. If you can find a good deal on this place it's worth it; otherwise, I'd suggest looking at other hotels in the area around Michigan Avenue.

The Westin - Northwest Chicago has a very elegant look and feel. However, on this occasion, we found sheets with old blood stains, which although laundered and likely clean, you would think they would do more to eradicate the unsightliness. Add to this, vacuum cleaners loud and constant from 1 to 3 a.m. and you get the sense they are oblivious people are there to sleep. The final straw was a ridiculously priced menu (with 20% service charge automatically added per person's meal aside from any tips), and a room service breakfast complete with scrambled eggs that were more liquid than solid. In short, noisy, somewhat unclean, and food that appeared unsafe for consumption...all at Westin pricing. It wouldn't have been bad if the front desk staff upon checkout inquired how your stay was, rather, they must assume all is well. I didn't bother to say anything, as the staff seemed generally uninterested. Don't look for many amenities like free wi-fi, as this is a very a la carte hotel.

We arrived on a Saturday PM (when most of the loop is shut down) and even our transfer shuttle from O'Hare had no idea were the hotel was and basically dumped our bags on the side of the road when they got fed up looking.To be clear to get to the hotel you must enter the main revolving doors to get into 440 S La Salle. When inside you take the main bank of elevators to floor 39 and transfer from there to a small elevator (next to the main bank) to get to reception on floor 40. After the initial difficulties in finding the entrance to the building nothing could be simpler in getting into the hotel (using the security tab provided). Whats more because you are a little out of the way you feel very secure.The hotel itself, as has been stated before, is small - around 20 rooms. However reception and ousekeeping staff were friendly and courteous throughout - amongst the best I have ever encountered.Our room was amazing. Maybe there was not the same level of opulence you would get in a four or five star place but everything was clean and well maintained, particularly the bed.Because the hotel is small you didn't get things like pay per view movies but there was a thorough range of cable channels available which was fine for us.Clearly the best thing about the hotel was the view. We had a clear view of Buckingham Fountain and the Field Museum as well as the loop skyline and Lake Michigan. It was amazing to watch sunrise and sunset across the lake and not to be overlooked by anyone.There have been some comments previously about the continental breakfast. It was absolutely fine. There was a well stock supply of Coffee, Juice, Cereals, Bagels and Muffins. OK it's not what you would get at one of the major hotels around the Mag Mile but it is free.In response to some other comments there are better locations of hotels in the city. This hotel is right in the south of the Loop, so you do have a fair old walk for the Magnificent Mile and attractions such as Navy Pier. However, it is a good location for the Museum Campus and Grant Park and is certainly no more than ten blocks from Macys on State Street (and around three blocks from the Willis (Sears) Tower). It is also worth noting that there is an El Station right outside the hotel.Overall this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I can accept that it may not suit everyone but if you don't mind a little bit of walking then it is worth going for the view alone.

The breakfast there is excellent and the portions are huge and the other one we loved was on the street right behind the hotel, Eleven City Deli. A Jewish deli with lost of personality, great food, huge portions and great service. I'm already planning my next trip to the windy city!

The rooms are not huge, but a comfortable size - only the bathroom stands out as small (there is no bath, only a shower), but that wasn't a big deal for me. Everything you need is still there. The rooms are very clean. Temperature comfortable. Had no problem sleeping in this hotel, except that you could hear other guests slamming shut their doors, which actually startled me a couple of times. Oh, and the purified chilled water comes really handy! All in all I was very satisfied with this hotel.

Very nice area to walk around and feal safe late at night. Lincoln park Zoo is about a mile walking distance from the hotel and there is plenty of places to eat. The front desk when we arrived was very helpful and pleasant. He gave us great advice about the places we were inquiring about ( eating,music,sightseeing). The room was pretty good as we had the King Junior suite, Bathrooms are very small, not much room around the sink to place anything. Beds Are very very comfortable. Walls are very thin, you can hear everything, as we were next to the staircase and could hear everyone going up and down the stairs. If you stay hear I would not recommend staying on the West side of the Hotel, there are trucks loading in the Alley beside you at 7A.M and they are there for most of the morning, but there is an alley on the East side to but it is a through lane so it might not be so bad. Internet was free and worked very well. Continental breakfast was excellent and free, parking was behind the building and looked pretty safe. Staff could not have been any nicer. No hairdryer or microwave, TVs work great. Elevator is small and hallways have a funny smell. But overall I would stay here again and would recommend it as long as you know this is what this hotel offers.

Heating/AC is all or nothing - in this case all heat. To get any air circulation without turning on the heat, we had to open the window - and since it was a rainy couple of days, that was problematic. Without the window cracked open, it got a but stifling in the room. Bed was a miss as well - a little too hard.

Just steps to Clark St. to catch a bus or a 10min walk to the EL stop (BrynMar) Which over the years has become a less scary area. I would still hesitate to walk it alone at night but with a group of friends I don't think its an issue. The motel is located just off Clark St. directly between Andersonville and Rogers Park. Andersonville in the 23yrs I've been staying at HOC has become a vibrant diverse mecca of old timer Sweedish and more recently arrived gay and DINKy types. The neighbord is clean well lit and full of things to do and eat. Right at the point where Ashland meets Clark there is a Mexican Bakery that is just awsome. Just south on Clark is Sweedish Bakery and the famous Ann Sather is just a block or so further south on Clark. Inbetween are an array of sushi, mediterranian, latin american and american places to pick from to eat and a wonderful potpouri of shops. The Heart of Chicago staff is for the most part wonderfully friendly and helpful. Don in the evenings and Javed on day shift are always ready to give advise on where or how to get somewhere.. If they don't know they will usually find the answer. There is a relatively recent arrival. A younger lady who needs to work on her customer service skills and demeanor a bit. She comes of curt and gives the impression she really would rather be somewhere else. Hopefully that can be taken care of by management. Not something that some corrective guidance couldn't solve very easily. That said I will continue to come back. I had read other complaints here about inconsistent internet service... There are outdoor routers and 3 bands to get the wirless but connection was spotty at best. This needs to be corrected...

I was expecting the worst (I've stayed in some NASTY Travelodges before), but the location and price were excellent so I figured I'd take a chance. First of all, the front desk staff was so nice - I wanted to check in early so I could attend some meetings at the conference, and they didn't even blink (most hotels try to make you feel bad for not waiting until 3). The room was quite large, bright, clean and cheerful and the bed was really comfortable. There are two restaurants downstairs - the little diner was perfect for a quick breakfast or lunch (and surprisingly inexpensive) and the Thai place was fabulous. Every hotel staff member I spoke with was friendly and chatty (especially the maintenance guy - I needed help with the in-room safe and he took care of everything quickly!). My only complaint is that their cable menu is missing some obvious channels (Weather, Comedy Central), but no one should be watching TV when there's the whole city to explore. Speaking of exploration - the Art Institute is just up the block and the hotel is also a block from the shopping on Michigan and State Streets, so everything is really convenient.Altogether, the hotel is old and not nearly as nice as the Palmer House, but it was so inexpensive and much better than I expected. Would absolutely stay there again.

110,usa_illinois_chicago_extended_stay_america_chicago_skokie,"Jul 15 2009 	Do the calculus and staying here adds up.	Clean, updated property with spacious rooms. Property is merely 9 years old and has already undergone renovations, certainly a commendable choice on the part of the district managers. The parking lot is safe and well lit. The advantages of staying here are many: It is probably 124 feet from the Interstate (I-94), 5 miles from the Purple Line 'L' train (CTA - Chicago Transit Authority - www.transitchicago.com), providing access to the city of Chicago for only $2.25 (w/ transfer). Nearest stops are Central for Purple Line, or end of the line for the Yellow Line train (on Dempster St. near Grosse Pointe Blvd.). If one needs access to the Metra Commuter line, then travel a short 3 miles west toward the suburb of Glenview (metrarail.com). For those taking buses, there is the 205, 54a, 201 (all CTA buses), and the 208 and the 422 (both PACE buses - PACE is the suburban bus line - www.pacebus.com) The hotel has laundry facilities on-site ($1.50 wash, $1.50 dry). The location itself has a well-kept campus, and the surrounding community is clean and very safe. Should a guest need a place to shop, the location has close proximity to an outdoor mall, Old Orchard Shopping Mall (a very safe location, no trouble with roving gangs of young rabble rousers often seen in malls all across America). There are also two grocery stores that come to mind immediately (Jewel Osco, Garden Fresh Market). There is a Post Office across the street from the Jewel Osco on Skokie Blvd. Need a Target or Wal-Mart? Just drive 5 miles away to the suburb of Niles, get westbound on Golf Road and that will take you to the general area where Gold Road and Milwaukee Ave meet. Your department store needs will be met and there is another shopping mall (Golf Mill Shopping Mall) there with a Sears store among many others within. For Korean grocery stores, there is Super H Mart by Waukegan Road and Oakton St. Or, there is Assi on Miwaukee Ave just north of Dempster St. One recent attraction is the newly opened and christened Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center (http://www.ilholocaustmuseum.org/). Former United States President William Jefferson Clinton came with his entourage one Sunday in May 2009 to nearly shut down the surrounding areas and give a speech and to be with the local Jewish population and their neighbors from the area communities. I hear it a good place to visit, albeit sobering. Have time for a drink? There are a few ideas. If a person would like to see a large, expansive beer menu, go to a place called 'The Glen'. The Glen is an area that has recently been developed on the site of what used to be a United States Naval airfield. The Glen is situated in what is understood to be the suburb of Glenview, the business is called The Yardhouse. For those looking for a dive bar, take I-94 west, exit at Lake St., travel through the light and get into the left lane immediately after the light. Great little place Meier's Tavern (http://www.meierstavern.com/). Arguably the best bar nearest to the hotel. Not a place to see people or be seen, but to enjoy a bar the way bars were back when our grandparents inhabited them. Looking for food? The hotel has a kind of 'Dining In' menu that one might find in the downtown area hotels of Chicago, but just draws from local establishments. For pizza, I recommend this business called 'Vince's Pizza' (ask the front desk staff to assist with this). I am not a fan of the Giordano's Pizza that we promote here in the greater Chicagoland area. Lots of great flavor, excellent food at Vince's Pizza, even the delivery drivers are good to deal with. Being by the interstate affords some opportunity for kinds of cuisine. Sure, it is possible to grab something quick at Ruby Tuesday across the parking from the hotel (they do have great management and staff), but when one is by the interstate, why not take your clients or colleagues to one of the nearby North Shore communities for a dining experience? The local communities are Niles, Glenview, Northbrook, Evanston, Morton Grove, Park Ridge, Winnetka, Willmette, Skokie, Kenilworth, Highland Park. One of the local restaurants is called Hackney's on Harms. The General Manager of the Extended Stay swears by the place. Good place for a nice burger, I hear. Staying away from home is not ideal, but staying at this particular property will make the days away much more tolerable when on your business trip. The hotel is not too busy where getting assistance from the staff is unimaginable. They can help fetch a cab, they can answer your questions. Never have the staff been inaccessible when needing to resolve questions regarding my stay. In a way, this kind of seems to be a flagship (lead) property for Extended Stay America.  I believe one can grab a cab to O'Hare International airport for roughly 40 dollars each way. Be careful with the cabbies in this area, some are exceptional, but some will drive around when they actually know precisely where there hotel is. Try to be alert if the guy is playing dumb. It is only a few that have done, I hear, but one can never know if they are the next sucker to the games. A hospital is conveniently nearby, it is probably less than a mile from the Extended Stay America Skokie (ESA), NorthShore Skokie Hospital (http://www.northshore.org/clinicalservices/radio/default.aspx). Need a place to take some folks in the city of Chicago for an evening? Go on a Wednesday to see Alfonso Ponticelli and Swing Gitan at The Green Mill (www.greenmilljazz.com). This guy and his band are remarkable. It is mostly instrumental music, but it takes you back to France 1930's era and the jazz forms celebrated then as understood by Django Reinhardt. These are just some reflections on my stay at this property. I hope this helps all.

To start our stay we were given a room on the street side of the hotel, which my colleague (for personal reasons) had a problem with, we asked and they changed us immediately. The free wireless in room and computer access in the lobby was the best. I was able to do some work in my room and also utilize the printers in the lobby to print out my boarding passes for the next days flights.The room was spacious, with silly amenities that I love like a coffee maker, iro and ironing board, robe, toiletries, and bottles water.The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in; hotel or personal.

While it hasn't been &quot;new&quot; by any stretch since we've started staying here on yearly visits to the city, the &quot;old world charm&quot; (as another reviewer mentioned) is something of the past. Instead of old world, it's simply old. Our room (granted, only $100 for the city (and parking is extra), but we paid less for a MUCH better and newer room in the burbs) had peeling wallpaper, cracked walls and ceilings, obvious poorly-done patch jobs, and water stains. The bed was horrible as well.That being said, the bathroom was immaculate--which is nice. Additionally, the front desk staff was pleasant to deal with.If you're looking for a place to spend an hour a day in, then this could be your hotel.

Several hotels came up in the area, but all of them were between $250 and $450 for a 2 night stay. The Bellwood advised they didn't take reservations and you just had to turn up pn the day, which I did.I took a double room with a private ensuite bathroom for $40 for my first night, and had to take a double room with a shared bathroom for $30 per night on my second night.On check in, they ask for a $2 refundable key deposit and payment for the first night of your stay which is $30 or $40 depending on whether you want a shared or private bathroom or not. i paid the $40 for a private and was given my key. I opened the door to my room and felt instant dismay.It looked like a dilapidated building with wires handing out of the wall, a rusty old sink, a metal bed (although clean sheets and pillows). I looked at my so called &quot;ensuite&quot; and giggled. Tiles were up off the floor, the toilet pan was brown and the shower tray had mould about half an inch thick. It was obvious that it had been cleaned, just not SCRUBBED in a long long time. There was a tv in my room that did work and a sink in the corner, again, brown and stained.I checked the bed before I decided if I was staying or not, it was very clean so I decided to tell myself &quot;what can you expect for $40 per night&quot;. I stayed that night and actually got a very good nights sleep. There was no problem with noise and the room was secure, lockable from the inside.On the second day, I went out early to see the city and came back about midday to pay for my second nights stay as i couldnt be bothered trudging round to try and find alternative accommodation. I was advised by the receptionist that house keeping had packed all my things up and cleared my room as check out time was 11am, and I hadnt paid before then to keep the room. I was advised this on check in, so it WAS actually my fault. I was dreading that things may have gone missing, as all my things had been packed up by housekeeping staff and left in reception for me. After getting back into a different room, I thoroughly checked my belongings and EVERYTHING was there, including my laptop and passport. I was very reassured by this.They could only offer me a $30 room with shared bath for my 2nd night and I took this. The second room was a million times better than the first one. Much cleaner, in a better state of repair and I was actually quite pleased that I had lost my original room. Clean and comfortable bed and the bathroom was across the hall from my room. The bathroom however (clean as it was) was a bit of a disaster. Its small shower cubicles, with tepid water, and i could have probably pee'd faster than the dribble of water that came out of them. The toilets are in the same room, but theyre open plan - as in two toilets in the middle of the floor, with no cubicle, Its kinda embarassing when you have to go, as people can see you sat there!!!! Though, the americans just dont seem to care and get on with their business!! I'd recommend going to the petrol station across the street if you need anything other than a pee!!!!!!!!!!! :))))))Again, I got a good nights sleep in the second room and checked out about 9am on the second morning.All in all, i had a comfortable stay at this hotel, but please please beware, this is at the VERY BOTTOM END of budget accommodation. Its cheap, VERY cheap for Chicago, but at the same time, grim to look at. If all you care about is a bed to sleep in and somewhere to dump your bags, then it's fine, otherwise, i'd probably steer clear.Asked if i'd stay here again, well I would have to be 100% certain that there was nowhere else available before I turned up to stay at this place again. If I was forced to stay here with no other option though, I would. Not for the faint hearted!!The staff in the hotel were friendly enough which was nice, but again, lower thann basic accommodation, may be an idea to ask to see your room and make your mind up before you hand over your money.

Staff said, &quot;It happens.&quot; They would not clean the room, spray the room, or move us to a different room. They bumped us down from a two bed room to a single bed, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PREPAID FOR A DOUBLE BED ROOM. aND TO TOP IT OFF, THEY COMPLETELY PULLED OUT STUFF FROM OUR ROOM WHILE WE WERE GONE when they decided they had no space for us. They gave us no warning of this. Now, I can't get a refund.

130,usa_illinois_chicago_delaware_towers,"May 1 2003	You get what you pay	I got Delaware Towers from the web. While there was nothing in the description that was wrong, it was a bit misleading. The studios are depressing because they are small, dark, and seedy though clean. There was no outlet I could use for my laptop in the studio either. The one bedroom is much better in every respect but it is still not a place I'd want to spend much time. I wanted a kitchen so that I would have the option of cooking some meals instead of dining out, but the coffee maker had a corroded cord that was an electrical fire waiting to happen. The location is great but the one elevator can take a very long time. You get what you pay for here. It's cheap but not a bargain.

I was surprised that the rooms were in such good shape. The hotel is inexpensive and in a very active part of the city. The businesses and entertainment in the area are exceptional. There is good transportation all around the city from the hotel. Some of the staff could use lessons on professional courtesy. All in all I had a very good experience at the hotel. My room attendant Anne was exceptional! If I owned this business I would give her a raise. All in all for the money that I paid - I got good service.

147,usa_illinois_chicago_chicago_lodge,"Oct 13 2008 	the worst hotel i have ever attempted to stay in.	This &quot;hotel&quot; is a complete and utter failure. I used to live near this hotel, in Andersonville, so I knew the location was not that bad. I had tickets to a concert and it happened to be the weekend of the marathon, so when i was trying to make hotel reservations, all the other hotels had a three-night minimum. This was all I could really find. When we arrived, I realized it was going to be a bit seedy. When we got our keys, we went to the room only to find the door open a few inches. I immediately went back to the office and said I wasn't going in. The guy said to check the closets and he would be right there if I needed him. (!!!) I wanted my money back that instant, but thought I should just suck it up. We went in to find the room empty, thankfully, but in complete disrepair. Scuffs and stains all over the walls and everything else; it was a scene from a B-movie to say the least, and not worth a damn penny of the $80 they were asking. There were multiple other events/problems that led to me getting a refund even though the sign in the office said: &quot;No Refunds.&quot; We did not stay to sleep in the surely disease-infested beds.

148,usa_illinois_chicago_super_8_chicago_o_hare_south,"Nov 27 2008 	What a bad experience !!!	I will never forget this filthy place !I selected this place as I read terrible reviews about other hotels in the area. But this one was nothing different.The building and the whole facility was quite old. My room smelled horrible. It was something like clorox ar maybe some deodorants. It gave me really a hard time. In the middle of the night I called the front desk and asked for another room. I was told that it is not the room which has the problem, it is me which is the problem and the guy asked me if i am not comfortable with my room i can leave the hotel !!! OMG !!!!!!!!!!! It was midnight and i didn't have any car or access to internet. otherwise I would have left that filthy place immediately. The bed sheets all had stains on them. I had to throw them all away and tuck myself in my own spare sheet. The towels all had stains or long hairs !!! I am used to staying in low cost motels, but this one was really unacceptable. Positive thing about the place : the shuttle to ORD was helpful and other people in the front desk were at least polite . Worse than all, I really felt offended by the the rude night shift receptionist !!!If u don't want to become crazy from a filthy place just stay away from this disgusting place. I am really sorry for the manager and I am planning to write to Better Business bureau.

150,usa_illinois_chicago_sheffield_house,"	Hey it was ONLY 65 bucks a night!	Me and my boyfriend arrived in chicago with the intention to stay at the Sheffield House. We were really excited about the perfect location, walking distance of everything (including a cheap and amazing bakery for breakfast just north a block on the opposite side of the street ) and after a day of traveling we just wanted to drop off our stuff and start looking at the city.Staff: We arrived and the hotel staff wasn't exactly the most pleasant people but they quickly set us up and we got a one queen bedroom. When we got our key and paid (no refunds by the way) we went to our room and saw that there were NO sheets on the bed. gross. So after telling them they said they didn't have access to the laundry room or linen closet? Long story short we ended up spending the first night with no sheets. haha but we threw on a sweater a cuddled. We're troopers. The next morning after waking up at 6am basically begging and being overly polite we got blankets. A lot of blankets actually. They were clean just covered in some balls of lint. Better then I expected.Strange things: I saw there were pictures of people having fridges and microwaves in their rooms which I asked about. The older lady claimed that they never had those. Ugh. Whatever. Or that none of the rooms have a jacuzzi, which is pictured on the website. The place is a little more 'rustic' then what is pictured on their website.Cleanliness: The carpets were sticky, and there was some dried red stuff in the dresser drawers, and a cigarette burn in the mattress. But no bugs, mold (that I could see) or anything of that caliber. It was a little grimy but even the bathroom wasn't too bad. All very doable for a week. We only got cold water in the shower, but again, not the hugest deal to me. At the end of the day it was just another thing to sort of laugh at. Oh and someone stole the batteries from the tv remote. Location &amp; Cost: I don't think you can beat either. Your close to trains, bus stops, food, touristy things, etc. Next time I visit this amazing city the only thing I'm doing differently is calling ahead and making sure we have sheets!

151,usa_illinois_chicago_midway_inn,"Jul 7 2009 	WORST HOTEL EVER!!!! Guaranteed to make your skin crawl!!!	This is without a dirt the nastiest hotel/motel/inn that I have ever stayed in. Fist of all, when walking in, you can taste the cancer in the air! (That is how thick the smell of cigarette smoke is!) I should have known not to stay there when after checking in, the worker gave me the key to my room AND THE REMOTE TO THE TV!!! LOL We put our stuff down in the room and left immediately to get some dinner, as it was quite late. Upon returning, we get into the dim-lit room which had the furnishings of a one-night-stand stop. That includes a chewed piece of bubble gum in the shower, torn bath towels, a tray and ice bucket labeled from the Ramada hotel and soap bars from Super 8 Motel!! Not sure how they got those items, because I would bet my life that they don't have an agreement with any of those groups. I decided that I might just be very picky, and we decided to get some sleep since we were both very tired from our flight. But once we pulled back the blanket and found curly hair on the sheets and the pillow cases, I decided that I could not stay there, especially with my girlfriend. At 2 a.m. while waiting to speak with the attendant at the front desk, I was able to overhear a pleasant conversation where a respectable customer rents a room for the &quot;four hour special&quot; of $50. Upon doing so, his male friend enters followed by 2 very short and very plump ladies, and then off they all were to have what I can only figure to be a very quiet night of sleep, because what else would they be doing in a hotel room for 4 hours? Now to think that my girlfriend and I would be sleeping in the same bed as some guy who rented the room for 4 hours, and assuming that they so not clean the rooms every four hours, I was decidedly not going to stay there at all.I get to the front desk and complain to them that I will not stay in their hotel and that I wanted a refund as I had not even stayed there for 2 hours. I was promptly informed that according to the hotel policy, I had only 5 minutes after entering the room to decide whether I wanted to stay or not. When I told the attendant that we simply placed our bags in the room at midnight when we checked in, and went to get something to eat, she told me that the rule still applied. I told her to call the manager because I was not going to pay a thing (mind you they take full payment up front). She called the &quot;manager&quot; who was sleeping and decided not to come out, but told her that nothing could be done till the next day. I later found out that the manager ended up being the homeless looking fellow who was wandering the lobby in shorts and a torn T-Shirt when I was checking in. Needless to say we called a taxi immediately and went to the Holiday Inn Express just a few minutes away near to the Midway Airport. Spend the extra money and stay in a place where you wont get an STD from the sheets! Nothing is worth more while traveling than a clean hotel room and a respectable hotel in which to rest your head.NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!! If you respect yourself and your loved ones, you will not step foot into this cesspool!

153,usa_illinois_chicago_milshire_hotel,"Oct 14 2009 	Bates Motel	I've stayed at some run down places all over the world, but this place takes the cake. First off it is a brothel, and filled with meth/crack heads. I have no idea how this place passes any inspections. I was going to a couple of shows at the Congress theater, and this place is the closest place to it, so I thought I'd try it out even though the reviews were bad. When we first walked in we had to talk to a guy behind a window and pay, then we were buzzed though another door where we had to go up stairs battling crack heads on the way up. When I got to my room I looked around and found out that I was sharing a bathroom with the room next door, which had some shady charactars in it. I would have never trusted my belongings in my room with only a plywood door between us. Then I sat on the bed and realized it was covered in plastic sheets under the covers. I looked at the plastic sheets and they were plastic wrap with duct tape. The sheets were also full of awsome yellow stains. Luckily we were given a refund and did not have to stay, otherwise I would probably not have been able to written this because I would have been kidnapped and sold into a lifetime of male erotic sexual slavery.

154,usa_illinois_chicago_abbott_hotel,"Sep 21 2009 	Slum	Not only are the rooms jacked up but the Manager of the Building is total lacking customer service skills and has no respect for heterosexual people obviously. I had never met this guy before and told him about my shower not working in my room in which I paid for a private room with shower and he acted like a kid, stating &quot;you can leave when your rent is up&quot;. My rent is up on Tuesday, at noon, and I definitely would be out of the building. If Abbott wants its hotel to improve, it first must rid of the manager. And the next time a paying customer states they shower is not working the Manager should just say I will have maintenance take a look at the situation and we will have an answer for you when you get back. Belmont is a historical place and ABBOTT HOTEL must shape itself around the Beauty Belmont holds instead of having a Bum Manager run and ruin ABBOTTS Hotel. GET RID OF THE MANAGER! Once you do that, I think the place will get better ratings.
